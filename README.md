This assignment analyzes the given data from the merging of two different DataFrames from a pharmaceutical company doing a clinical study on a new cancer drug with the testing on mice. The first DataFrame is the mouse metadata and the second DataFrame includes the study results.
The merged data was cleaned to remove the duplicate entry of mouse "g989", then a summary of the statistics was created after the data was cleaned.
Various visualizations such as bar and pie charts, box plots, scatter and line plots were used to examine the data and linear regression was used to calculate the correlation and regression of the data.
Various statistics and calculations are included the in the visualizations in order to share beneficial information included within this dataset.
Additional care was taken to utilize a variety of colors, font style, font weight, font size, and font type to create unique visualizations from the data.
